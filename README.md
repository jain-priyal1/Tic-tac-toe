Tic Tac Toe Game
This repository contains a simple implementation of the classic Tic Tac Toe game in Python. 
The game is played in the console between two players, X and O, and allows them to take turns marking spaces on a 3x3 grid.
The first player to get three of their marks in a row (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally) wins the game.

Getting Started
To run this game, you need to have Python installed on your system. This project uses Python 3.

The game board is displayed, showing the current state of moves.
X always starts the game.
Enter a number between 0 and 8 to place your mark on the corresponding space.
The game alternates turns between X and O until one player wins or the game ends in a draw.
The game will declare the winner or indicate a draw at the end of each game.
